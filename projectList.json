I first sketched out the face on paper, scanned and retraced in Adobe Illustrator then modeled the bowl and imprint in Fusion 360. The final model was printed on the Ultimaker 2+ using Hatchbox White PLA.",

The game's code was written in C# for Unity, with much of the art taking on Super Nintendo and Game Boy Advance spritework as inspiration. I primarily did most of the code and art, while my friend OneWeirdGuy did the sprites for the ship, while the music and fonts were from outside sources.",
